A pure Go ZeroMQ library.

**PLEASE DO NOT TAKE THIS PROJECT SERIOUSLY**

This is nothing more than a proof-of-concept exercise, for myself.

If you choose to disregard the above warning, and contribute to the project, I
would be more than willing to accept any pull requests.

Don't say I didn't warn you.
